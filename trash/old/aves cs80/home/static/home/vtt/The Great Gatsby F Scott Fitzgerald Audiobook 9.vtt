00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.129
Chapter 9

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:11.259
After two years I remember the rest of that
day, and that night and the next day, only

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:17.180
as an endless drill of police and photographers
and newspaper men in and out of Gatsby’s

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:24.770
front door. A rope stretched across the main
gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious,

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.480
but little boys soon discovered that they
could enter through my yard, and there were

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.920
always a few of them clustered open-mouthed
about the pool. Someone with a positive manner,

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.760
perhaps a detective, used the expression “madman”
as he bent over Wilson’s body that afternoon,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.589
and the adventitious authority of his voice
set the key for the newspaper reports next

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.809
morning.

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:58.909
Most of those reports were a nightmare — grotesque,
circumstantial, eager, and untrue. When Michaelis’s

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.800
testimony at the inquest brought to light
Wilson’s suspicions of his wife I thought

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.150
the whole tale would shortly be served up
in racy pasquinade — but Catherine, who

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.390
might have said anything, didn’t say a word.
She showed a surprising amount of character

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.960
about it too — looked at the coroner with
determined eyes under that corrected brow

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.850
of hers, and swore that her sister had never
seen Gatsby, that her sister was completely

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.900
happy with her husband, that her sister had
been into no mischief whatever. She convinced

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.080
herself of it, and cried into her handkerchief,
as if the very suggestion was more than she

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:45.670
could endure. S. Wilson was reduced to a man
“deranged by grief” in order that the

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.600
case might remain in its simplist form. And
it rested there.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.140
But all this part of it seemed remote and
unessential. I found myself on Gatsby’s

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.530
side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned
news of the catastrophe to West Egg village,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.519
every surmise about him, and every practical
question, was referred to me. At first I was

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:17.799
surprised and confused; then, as he lay in
his house and didn’t move or breathe or

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:24.340
speak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that
I was responsible, because no one else was

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.109
interested — interested, I mean, with that
intense personal interest to which every one

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:34.489
has some vague right at the end.

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.189
I called up Daisy half an hour after we found
him, called her instinctively and without

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:44.769
hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away
early that afternoon, and taken baggage with

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:45.469
them.

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:47.590
“Left no address?”

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.290
“No.”

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.819
“Say when they’d be back?”

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:52.530
“No.”

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.840
“Any idea where they are? How I could reach
them?”

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.090
“I don’t know. Can’t say.”

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.909
I wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted
to go into the room where he lay and reassure

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.969
him: “I’ll get somebody for you, Gatsby.
Don’t worry. Just trust me and I’ll get

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.939
somebody for you ——”

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:18.019
Meyer Wolfsheim’s name wasn’t in the phone
book. The butler gave me his office address

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.230
on Broadway, and I called Information, but
by the time I had the number it was long after

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.969
five, and no one answered the phone.

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.230
“Will you ring again?”

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.700
“I’ve rung them three times.”

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.129
“It’s very important.”

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.310
“Sorry. I’m afraid no one’s there.”

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.889
I went back to the drawing-room and thought
for an instant that they were chance visitors,

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.950
all these official people who suddenly filled
it. But, as they drew back the sheet and looked

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.790
at Gatsby with unmoved eyes, his protest continued
in my brain:

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.489
“Look here, old sport, you’ve got to get
somebody for me. You’ve got to try hard.

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.969
I can’t go through this alone.”

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:04.799
Some one started to ask me questions, but
I broke away and going up-stairs looked hastily

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.939
through the unlocked parts of his desk — he’d
never told me definitely that his parents

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:16.329
were dead. But there was nothing — only
the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.389
violence, staring down from the wall.

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.340
Next morning I sent the butler to New York
with a letter to Wolfsheim, which asked for

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.310
information and urged him to come out on the
next train. That request seemed superfluous

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.599
when I wrote it. I was sure he’d start when
he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:43.690
there’d be a wire from Daisy before noon
— but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfsheim arrived;

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:50.860
no one arrived except more police and photographers
and newspaper men. When the butler brought

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:57.180
back Wolfsheim’s answer I began to have
a feeling of defiance, of scornful solidarity

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.560
between Gatsby and me against them all.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:07.490
Dear Mr. Carraway. This has been one of the
most terrible shocks of my life to me I hardly

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.060
can believe it that it is true at all. Such
a mad act as that man did should make us all

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.699
think. I cannot come down now as I am tied
up in some very important business and cannot

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:25.930
get mixed up in this thing now. If there is
anything I can do a little later let me know

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:33.870
in a letter by Edgar. I hardly know where
I am when I hear about a thing like this and

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.599
am completely knocked down and out.

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:42.620
Yours truly Meyer Wolfshiem

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.229
and then hasty addenda beneath:

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:51.889
Let me know about the funeral etc. Do not
know his family at all.

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:56.229
When the phone rang that afternoon and Long
Distance said Chicago was calling I thought

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.860
this would be Daisy at last. But the connection
came through as a man’s voice, very thin

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.090
and far away.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.080
“This is Slagle speaking . . . ”

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.400
“Yes?” The name was unfamiliar.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.129
“Hell of a note, isn’t it? Get my wire?”

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:14.340
“There haven’t been any wires.”

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.610
“Young Parke’s in trouble,” he said
rapidly. “They picked him up when he handed

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.280
the bonds over the counter. They got a circular
from New York giving ’em the numbers just

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.720
five minutes before. What d’you know about
that, hey? You never can tell in these hick

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.159
towns ——”

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:34.689
“Hello!” I interrupted breathlessly. “Look
here — this isn’t Mr. Gatsby. Mr. Gatsby’s

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:35.509
dead.”

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:41.439
There was a long silence on the other end
of the wire, followed by an exclamation . . . then

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:46.720
a quick squawk as the connection was broken.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.520
I think it was on the third day that a telegram
signed Henry C. Gatz arrived from a town in

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.990
Minnesota. It said only that the sender was
leaving immediately and to postpone the funeral

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.580
until he came.

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:06.840
It was Gatsby’s father, a solemn old man,
very helpless and dismayed, bundled up in

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:13.659
a long cheap ulster against the warm September
day. His eyes leaked continuously with excitement,

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:18.199
and when I took the bag and umbrella from
his hands he began to pull so incessantly

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:24.370
at his sparse gray beard that I had difficulty
in getting off his coat. He was on the point

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:28.550
of collapse, so I took him into the music
room and made him sit down while I sent for

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:34.180
something to eat. But he wouldn’t eat, and
the glass of milk spilled from his trembling

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:35.469
hand.

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:44.120
“I saw it in the Chicago newspaper,” he
said. “It was all in the Chicago newspaper.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.780
I started right away.”

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:51.889
“I didn’t know how to reach you.” His
eyes, seeing nothing, moved ceaselessly about

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:53.219
the room.

00:07:53.219 --> 00:07:58.039
“It was a madman,” he said. “He must
have been mad.”

00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:01.409
“Wouldn’t you like some coffee?” I urged
him.

00:08:01.409 --> 00:08:05.189
“I don’t want anything. I’m all right
now, Mr. ——”

00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:06.330
“Carraway.”

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:16.080
“Well, I’m all right now. Where have they
got Jimmy?” I took him into the drawing-room,

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.840
where his son lay, and left him there. Some
little boys had come up on the steps and were

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:30.139
looking into the hall; when I told them who
had arrived, they went reluctantly away.

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:35.599
After a little while Mr. Gatz opened the door
and came out, his mouth ajar, his face flushed

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:43.700
slightly, his eyes leaking isolated and unpunctual
tears. He had reached an age where death no

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.450
longer has the quality of ghastly surprise,
and when he looked around him now for the

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:53.850
first time and saw the height and splendor
of the hall and the great rooms opening out

00:08:53.850 --> 00:09:01.250
from it into other rooms, his grief began
to be mixed with an awed pride. I helped him

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:06.110
to a bedroom up-stairs; while he took off
his coat and vest I told him that all arrangements

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.899
had been deferred until he came.

00:09:08.899 --> 00:09:12.250
“I didn’t know what you’d want, Mr.
Gatsby ——”

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.950
“Gatz is my name.”

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.000
“— Mr. Gatz. I thought you might want
to take the body West.”

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.839
He shook his head.

00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:31.200
“Jimmy always liked it better down East.
He rose up to his position in the East. Were

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.089
you a friend of my boy’s, Mr. —?”

00:09:34.089 --> 00:09:36.950
“We were close friends.”

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:43.769
“He had a big future before him, you know.
He was only a young man, but he had a lot

00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:46.970
of brain power here.”

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:49.660
He touched his head impressively, and I nodded.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:58.760
“If he’d of lived, he’d of been a great
man. A man like James J. Hill. He’d of helped

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.250
build up the country.”

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:06.160
“That’s true,” I said, uncomfortably.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.389
He fumbled at the embroidered coverlet, trying
to take it from the bed, and lay down stiffly

00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:15.899
— was instantly asleep.

00:10:15.899 --> 00:10:20.389
That night an obviously frightened person
called up, and demanded to know who I was

00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:22.500
before he would give his name.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.560
“This is Mr. Carraway,” I said.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:33.910
“Oh!” He sounded relieved. “This is
Klipspringer.” I was relieved too, for that

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:39.149
seemed to promise another friend at Gatsby’s
grave. I didn’t want it to be in the papers

00:10:39.149 --> 00:10:44.620
and draw a sightseeing crowd, so I’d been
calling up a few people myself. They were

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.940
hard to find.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:52.110
“The funeral’s to-morrow,” I said. “Three
o’clock, here at the house. I wish you’d

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.389
tell anybody who’d be interested.”

00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:59.670
“Oh, I will,” he broke out hastily. “Of
course I’m not likely to see anybody, but

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.240
if I do.”

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.930
His tone made me suspicious.

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:05.480
“Of course you’ll be there yourself.”

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:11.329
“Well, I’ll certainly try. What I called
up about is ——”

00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:16.000
“Wait a minute,” I interrupted. “How
about saying you’ll come?”

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.320
“Well, the fact is — the truth of the
matter is that I’m staying with some people

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:25.399
up here in Greenwich, and they rather expect
me to be with them to-morrow. In fact, there’s

00:11:25.399 --> 00:11:31.130
a sort of picnic or something. Of course I’ll
do my very best to get away.”

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:38.110
I ejaculated an unrestrained “Huh!” and
he must have heard me, for he went on nervously:

00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:43.880
“What I called up about was a pair of shoes
I left there. I wonder if it’d be too much

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:48.630
trouble to have the butler send them on. You
see, they’re tennis shoes, and I’m sort

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:52.759
of helpless without them. My address is care
of B. F. ——”

00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:59.170
I didn’t hear the rest of the name, because
I hung up the receiver.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:06.910
After that I felt a certain shame for Gatsby
— one gentleman to whom I telephoned implied

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:12.870
that he had got what he deserved. However,
that was my fault, for he was one of those

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:18.350
who used to sneer most bitterly at Gatsby
on the courage of Gatsby’s liquor, and I

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:21.190
should have known better than to call him.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:27.040
The morning of the funeral I went up to New
York to see Meyer Wolfsheim; I couldn’t

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.190
seem to reach him any other way. The door
that I pushed open, on the advice of an elevator

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:37.579
boy, was marked “The Swastika Holding Company,”
and at first there didn’t seem to be any

00:12:37.579 --> 00:12:43.860
one inside. But when I’d shouted “hello”
several times in vain, an argument broke out

00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:50.570
behind a partition, and presently a lovely
Jewess appeared at an interior door and scrutinized

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.610
me with black hostile eyes.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:59.790
“Nobody’s in,” she said. “Mr. Wolfsheim’s
gone to Chicago.”

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:05.089
The first part of this was obviously untrue,
for someone had begun to whistle “The Rosary,”

00:13:05.089 --> 00:13:06.440
tunelessly, inside.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:10.300
“Please say that Mr. Carraway wants to see
him.”

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.750
“I can’t get him back from Chicago, can
I?”

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:20.199
At this moment a voice, unmistakably Wolfsheim’s,
called “Stella!” from the other side of

00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:21.259
the door.

00:13:21.259 --> 00:13:25.230
“Leave your name on the desk,” she said
quickly. “I’ll give it to him when he

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:25.810
gets back.”

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.600
“But I know he’s there.”

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:34.560
She took a step toward me and began to slide
her hands indignantly up and down her hips.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:39.790
“You young men think you can force your
way in here any time,” she scolded. “We’re

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:45.440
getting sickantired of it. When I say he’s
in Chicago, he’s in Chicago.”

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.089
I mentioned Gatsby.

00:13:47.089 --> 00:13:55.329
“Oh — h!” She looked at me over again.
“Will you just — What was your name?”

00:13:55.329 --> 00:14:00.670
She vanished. In a moment Meyer Wolfsheim
stood solemnly in the doorway, holding out

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:07.430
both hands. He drew me into his office, remarking
in a reverent voice that it was a sad time

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:11.920
for all of us, and offered me a cigar.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:19.269
“My memory goes back to when I first met
him,” he said. “A young major just out

00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:27.190
of the army and covered over with medals he
got in the war. He was so hard up he had to

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:34.170
keep on wearing his uniform because he couldn’t
buy some regular clothes. First time I saw

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:40.579
him was when he come into Winebrenner’s
poolroom at Forty-third Street and asked for

00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:45.660
a job. He hadn’t eat anything for a couple
of days. ‘come on have some lunch with me,’

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:51.389
I sid. He ate more than four dollars’ worth
of food in half an hour.”

00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:54.380
“Did you start him in business?” I inquired.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:57.209
“Start him! I made him.”

00:14:57.209 --> 00:14:57.730
“Oh.”

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:06.889
“I raised him up out of nothing, right out
of the gutter. I saw right away he was a fine-appearing,

00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:12.449
gentlemanly young man, and when he told me
he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him

00:15:12.449 --> 00:15:19.180
good. I got him to join up in the American
Legion and he used to stand high there. Right

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:27.009
off he did some work for a client of mine
up to Albany. We were so thick like that in

00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:34.990
everything.”— he held up two bulbous fingers
——” always together.”

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:40.079
I wondered if this partnership had included
the World’s Series transaction in 1919.

00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:49.209
“Now he’s dead,” I said after a moment.
“You were his closest friend, so I know

00:15:49.209 --> 00:15:52.230
you’ll want to come to his funeral this
afternoon.”

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.889
“I’d like to come.”

00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:56.440
“Well, come then.”

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:02.709
The hair in his nostrils quivered slightly,
and as he shook his head his eyes filled with

00:16:02.709 --> 00:16:03.449
tears.

00:16:03.449 --> 00:16:10.660
“I can’t do it — I can’t get mixed
up in it,” he said.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.819
“There’s nothing to get mixed up in. It’s
all over now.”

00:16:14.819 --> 00:16:23.329
“When a man gets killed I never like to
get mixed up in it in any way. I keep out.

00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:28.540
When I was a young man it was different — if
a friend of mine died, no matter how, I stuck

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:36.259
with them to the end. You may think that’s
sentimental, but I mean it — to the bitter

00:16:36.259 --> 00:16:37.250
end.”

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:43.319
I saw that for some reason of his own he was
determined not to come, so I stood up.

00:16:43.319 --> 00:16:48.480
“Are you a college man?” he inquired suddenly.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.540
For a moment I thought he was going to suggest
a “gonnegtion,” but he only nodded and

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.490
shook my hand.

00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:03.870
“Let us learn to show our friendship for
a man when he is alive and not after he is

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:14.799
dead,” he suggested. “After that my own
rule is to let everything alone.”

00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:21.459
When I left his office the sky had turned
dark and I got back to West Egg in a drizzle.

00:17:21.459 --> 00:17:26.280
After changing my clothes I went next door
and found Mr. Gatz walking up and down excitedly

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:33.030
in the hall. His pride in his son and in his
son’s possessions was continually increasing

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.090
and now he had something to show me.

00:17:36.090 --> 00:17:42.690
“Jimmy sent me this picture.” He took
out his wallet with trembling fingers. “Look

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:43.630
there.”

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:48.860
It was a photograph of the house, cracked
in the corners and dirty with many hands.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:55.230
He pointed out every detail to me eagerly.
“Look there!” and then sought admiration

00:17:55.230 --> 00:18:01.450
from my eyes. He had shown it so often that
I think it was more real to him now than the

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:02.470
house itself.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:11.840
“Jimmy sent it to me. I think it’s a very
pretty picture. It shows up well.”

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.500
“Very well. Had you seen him lately?”

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:23.650
“He come out to see me two years ago and
bought me the house I live in now. Of course

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:30.210
we was broke up when he run off from home,
but I see now there was a reason for it. He

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:37.429
knew he had a big future in front of him.
And ever since he made a success he was very

00:18:37.429 --> 00:18:43.929
generous with me.” He seemed reluctant to
put away the picture, held it for another

00:18:43.929 --> 00:18:49.360
minute, lingeringly, before my eyes. Then
he returned the wallet and pulled from his

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.880
pocket a ragged old copy of a book called
Hopalong Cassidy.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:19:00.010
“Look here, this is a book he had when he
was a boy. It just shows you.”

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:06.960
He opened it at the back cover and turned
it around for me to see. On the last fly-leaf

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:14.380
was printed the word Schedule, and the date
September 12, 1906, and underneath:

out} $3.00 per week Be better to parents

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:15.600
“I come across this book by accident,”
said the old man. “It just shows you, don’t

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.360
it?”

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.840
“It just shows you.”

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:25.840
“Jimmy was bound to get ahead. He always
had some resolves like this or something.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:33.090
Do you notice what he’s got about improving
his mind? He was always great for that. He

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:40.470
told me I et like a hog once, and I beat him
for it.”

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:45.270
He was reluctant to close the book, reading
each item aloud and then looking eagerly at

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:53.580
me. I think he rather expected me to copy
down the list for my own use.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.750
A little before three the Lutheran minister
arrived from Flushing, and I began to look

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:04.380
involuntarily out the windows for other cars.
So did Gatsby’s father. And as the time

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:09.450
passed and the servants came in and stood
waiting in the hall, his eyes began to blink

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:16.190
anxiously, and he spoke of the rain in a worried,
uncertain way. The minister glanced several

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:21.590
times at his watch, so I took him aside and
asked him to wait for half an hour. But it

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:27.039
wasn’t any use. Nobody came.

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:31.340
About five o’clock our procession of three
cars reached the cemetery and stopped in a

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:38.020
thick drizzle beside the gate — first a
motor hearse, horribly black and wet, then

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:43.809
Mr. Gatz and the minister and I in the limousine,
and a little later four or five servants and

00:21:43.809 --> 00:21:51.059
the postman from West Egg in Gatsby’s station
wagon, all wet to the skin. As we started

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:56.510
through the gate into the cemetery I heard
a car stop and then the sound of someone splashing

00:21:56.510 --> 00:22:03.400
after us over the soggy ground. I looked around.
It was the man with owl-eyed glasses whom

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:08.580
I had found marvelling over Gatsby’s books
in the library one night three months before.

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:13.909
I’d never seen him since then. I don’t
know how he knew about the funeral, or even

00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:19.850
his name. The rain poured down his thick glasses,
and he took them off and wiped them to see

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:25.039
the protecting canvas unrolled from Gatsby’s
grave.

00:22:25.039 --> 00:22:31.610
I tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment,
but he was already too far away, and I could

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:40.880
only remember, without resentment, that Daisy
hadn’t sent a message or a flower. Dimly

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:46.559
I heard someone murmur, “Blessed are the
dead that the rain falls on,” and then the

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:53.529
owl-eyed man said “Amen to that,” in a
brave voice.

00:22:53.529 --> 00:22:58.909
We straggled down quickly through the rain
to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke to me by the gate.

00:22:58.909 --> 00:23:02.400
“I couldn’t get to the house,” he remarked.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.529
“Neither could anybody else.”

00:23:04.529 --> 00:23:11.539
“Go on!” He started. “Why, my God! they
used to go there by the hundreds.” He took

00:23:11.539 --> 00:23:15.730
off his glasses and wiped them again, outside
and in.

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:21.159
“The poor son-of-a-bitch,” he said.

00:23:21.159 --> 00:23:25.929
One of my most vivid memories is of coming
back West from prep school and later from

00:23:25.929 --> 00:23:31.049
college at Christmas time. Those who went
farther than Chicago would gather in the old

00:23:31.049 --> 00:23:36.440
dim Union Station at six o’clock of a December
evening, with a few Chicago friends, already

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:42.130
caught up into their own holiday gayeties,
to bid them a hasty good-by. I remember the

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:46.779
fur coats of the girls returning from Miss
This-or-that’s and the chatter of frozen

00:23:46.779 --> 00:23:51.549
breath and the hands waving overhead as we
caught sight of old acquaintances, and the

00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:56.710
matchings of invitations: “Are you going
to the Ordways’? the Herseys’? the Schultzes’?”

00:23:56.710 --> 00:24:04.190
and the long green tickets clasped tight in
our gloved hands. And last the murky yellow

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:10.169
cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul
railroad looking cheerful as Christmas itself

00:24:10.169 --> 00:24:13.000
on the tracks beside the gate.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.350
When we pulled out into the winter night and
the real snow, our snow, began to stretch

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:23.950
out beside us and twinkle against the windows,
and the dim lights of small Wisconsin stations

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:30.850
moved by, a sharp wild brace came suddenly
into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:35.690
as we walked back from dinner through the
cold vestibules, unutterably aware of our

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:41.539
identity with this country for one strange
hour, before we melted indistinguishably into

00:24:41.539 --> 00:24:43.080
it again.

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:49.990
That’s my Middle West — not the wheat
or the prairies or the lost Swede towns, but

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:55.890
the thrilling returning trains of my youth,
and the street lamps and sleigh bells in the

00:24:55.890 --> 00:25:02.720
frosty dark and the shadows of holly wreaths
thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.929
part of that, a little solemn with the feel
of those long winters, a little complacent

00:25:08.929 --> 00:25:13.820
from growing up in the Carraway house in a
city where dwellings are still called through

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:21.259
decades by a family’s name. I see now that
this has been a story of the West, after all

00:25:21.259 --> 00:25:29.440
— Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and Jordan and I,
were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:36.809
some deficiency in common which made us subtly
unadaptable to Eastern life.

00:25:36.809 --> 00:25:41.399
Even when the East excited me most, even when
I was most keenly aware of its superiority

00:25:41.399 --> 00:25:47.669
to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond
the Ohio, with their interminable inquisitions

00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:53.710
which spared only the children and the very
old — even then it had always for me a quality

00:25:53.710 --> 00:26:01.830
of distortion. West Egg, especially, still
figures in my more fantastic dreams. I see

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:08.980
it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred
houses, at once conventional and grotesque,

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:15.690
crouching under a sullen, overhanging sky
and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:21.640
solemn men in dress suits are walking along
the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:28.690
a drunken woman in a white evening dress.
Her hand, which dangles over the side, sparkles

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:35.840
cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in
at a house — the wrong house. But no one

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:41.059
knows the woman’s name, and no one cares.

00:26:41.059 --> 00:26:47.539
After Gatsby’s death the East was haunted
for me like that, distorted beyond my eyes’

00:26:47.539 --> 00:26:54.690
power of correction. So when the blue smoke
of brittle leaves was in the air and the wind

00:26:54.690 --> 00:27:00.929
blew the wet laundry stiff on the line I decided
to come back home.

00:27:00.929 --> 00:27:08.010
There was one thing to be done before I left,
an awkward, unpleasant thing that perhaps

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:15.260
had better have been let alone. But I wanted
to leave things in order and not just trust

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:24.149
that obliging and indifferent sea to sweep
my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked

00:27:24.149 --> 00:27:30.909
over and around what had happened to us together,
and what had happened afterward to me, and

00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:34.779
she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big
chair.

00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:39.950
She was dressed to play golf, and I remember
thinking she looked like a good illustration,

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:47.080
her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair
the color of an autumn leaf, her face the

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:54.470
same brown tint as the fingerless glove on
her knee. When I had finished she told me

00:27:54.470 --> 00:28:01.960
without comment that she was engaged to another
man. I doubted that, though there were several

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:08.350
she could have married at a nod of her head,
but I pretended to be surprised. For just

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:13.710
a minute I wondered if I wasn’t making a
mistake, then I thought it all over again

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:16.110
quickly and got up to say good-bye.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:23.669
“Nevertheless you did throw me over,”
said Jordan suddenly. “You threw me over

00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:28.140
on the telephone. I don’t give a damn about
you now, but it was a new experience for me,

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:30.669
and I felt a little dizzy for a while.”

00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:32.429
We shook hands.

00:28:32.429 --> 00:28:39.390
“Oh, and do you remember.”— she added
——” a conversation we had once about

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.679
driving a car?”

00:28:42.679 --> 00:28:43.730
“Why — not exactly.”

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:50.610
“You said a bad driver was only safe until
she met another bad driver? Well, I met another

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:57.059
bad driver, didn’t I? I mean it was careless
of me to make such a wrong guess. I thought

00:28:57.059 --> 00:29:03.039
you were rather an honest, straightforward
person. I thought it was your secret pride.”

00:29:03.039 --> 00:29:10.360
“I’m thirty,” I said. “I’m five
years too old to lie to myself and call it

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:11.370
honor.”

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:19.149
She didn’t answer. Angry, and half in love
with her, and tremendously sorry, I turned

00:29:19.149 --> 00:29:22.110
away.

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:28.409
One afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan.
He was walking ahead of me along Fifth Avenue

00:29:28.409 --> 00:29:34.120
in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out
a little from his body as if to fight off

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:39.440
interference, his head moving sharply here
and there, adapting itself to his restless

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:45.880
eyes. Just as I slowed up to avoid overtaking
him he stopped and began frowning into the

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:51.200
windows of a jewelry store. Suddenly he saw
me and walked back, holding out his hand.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:56.350
“What’s the matter, Nick? Do you object
to shaking hands with me?”

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.250
“Yes. You know what I think of you.”

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:04.769
“You’re crazy, Nick,” he said quickly.
“Crazy as hell. I don’t know what’s

00:30:04.769 --> 00:30:06.190
the matter with you.”

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:12.250
“Tom,” I inquired, “what did you say
to Wilson that afternoon?” He stared at

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:17.820
me without a word, and I knew I had guessed
right about those missing hours. I started

00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:21.320
to turn away, but he took a step after me
and grabbed my arm.

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:25.980
“I told him the truth,” he said. “He
came to the door while we were getting ready

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:32.649
to leave, and when I sent down word that we
weren’t in he tried to force his way up-stairs.

00:30:32.649 --> 00:30:38.029
He was crazy enough to kill me if I hadn’t
told him who owned the car. His hand was on

00:30:38.029 --> 00:30:42.130
a revolver in his pocket every minute he was
in the house ——” He broke off defiantly.

00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:48.659
“What if I did tell him? That fellow had
it coming to him. He threw dust into your

00:30:48.659 --> 00:30:54.940
eyes just like he did in Daisy’s, but he
was a tough one. He ran over Myrtle like you’d

00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:59.659
run over a dog and never even stopped his
car.”

00:30:59.659 --> 00:31:05.570
There was nothing I could say, except the
one unutterable fact that it wasn’t true.

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:10.440
“And if you think I didn’t have my share
of suffering — look here, when I went to

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:15.840
give up that flat and saw that damn box of
dog biscuits sitting there on the sideboard,

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:23.740
I sat down and cried like a baby. By God it
was awful ——”

00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:31.220
I couldn’t forgive him or like him, but
I saw that what he had done was, to him, entirely

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:41.320
justified. It was all very careless and confused.
They were careless people, Tom and Daisy — they

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:47.679
smashed up things and creatures and then retreated
back into their money or their vast carelessness,

00:31:47.679 --> 00:31:53.250
or whatever it was that kept them together,
and let other people clean up the mess they

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:56.830
had made. . . .

00:31:56.830 --> 00:32:02.380
I shook hands with him; it seemed silly not
to, for I felt suddenly as though I were talking

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:09.840
to a child. Then he went into the jewelry
store to buy a pearl necklace — or perhaps

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:17.000
only a pair of cuff buttons — rid of my
provincial squeamishness forever.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.899
Gatsby’s house was still empty when I left
— the grass on his lawn had grown as long

00:32:23.899 --> 00:32:30.169
as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village
never took a fare past the entrance gate without

00:32:30.169 --> 00:32:36.179
stopping for a minute and pointing inside;
perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby

00:32:36.179 --> 00:32:40.760
over to East Egg the night of the accident,
and perhaps he had made a story about it all

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:48.230
his own. I didn’t want to hear it and I
avoided him when I got off the train.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:53.580
I spent my Saturday nights in New York because
those gleaming, dazzling parties of his were

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:59.250
with me so vividly that I could still hear
the music and the laughter, faint and incessant,

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:06.809
from his garden, and the cars going up and
down his drive. One night I did hear a material

00:33:06.809 --> 00:33:14.029
car there, and saw its lights stop at his
front steps. But I didn’t investigate. Probably

00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:18.070
it was some final guest who had been away
at the ends of the earth and didn’t know

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:22.010
that the party was over.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:27.769
On the last night, with my trunk packed and
my car sold to the grocer, I went over and

00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:35.929
looked at that huge incoherent failure of
a house once more. On the white steps an obscene

00:33:35.929 --> 00:33:41.110
word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of
brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight,

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:47.710
and I erased it, drawing my shoe raspingly
along the stone. Then I wandered down to the

00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:52.340
beach and sprawled out on the sand.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:56.899
Most of the big shore places were closed now
and there were hardly any lights except the

00:33:56.899 --> 00:34:03.720
shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across
the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:10.600
inessential houses began to melt away until
gradually I became aware of the old island

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:18.210
here that flowered once for Dutch sailors’
eyes — a fresh, green breast of the new

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:25.070
world. Its vanished trees, the trees that
had made way for Gatsby’s house, had once

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:32.730
pandered in whispers to the last and greatest
of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:39.500
moment man must have held his breath in the
presence of this continent, compelled into

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:46.760
an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood
nor desired, face to face for the last time

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:55.050
in history with something commensurate to
his capacity for wonder.

00:34:55.050 --> 00:35:02.810
And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown
world, I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:08.680
he first picked out the green light at the
end of Daisy’s dock. He had come a long

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:13.880
way to this blue lawn, and his dream must
have seemed so close that he could hardly

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:22.290
fail to grasp it. He did not know that it
was already behind him, somewhere back in

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:28.150
that vast obscurity beyond the city, where
the dark fields of the republic rolled on

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:31.080
under the night.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:38.680
Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic
future that year by year recedes before us.

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:42.930
It eluded us then, but that’s no matter
— to-morrow we will run faster, stretch

00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:48.220
out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning
——

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:57.480
So we beat on, boats against the current,
borne back ceaselessly into the past.
